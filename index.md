At the library, we have been working together to make sure our digital collections and main site meet the technical standards of the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) and part of those efforts has been to make sure all of our video and audio files have transcripts. This is beneficial not only for our patrons using screen readers but also for all of our patrons to make oral history recordings keyword searchable.

<br>

> The following steps will guide you through how to generate a transcript of either audio or video files using Adobe Premiere. This will also describe how to edit and export these files or turn your transcripts into captions.

**A Note for Students**:

Adobe Suite, which includes Premiere, [is listed as being available on the student lab computers](https://support.uidaho.edu/TDClient/40/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=89) on the second floor of the library. Premiere is also available in the [digital editing station of the studio](https://www.lib.uidaho.edu/studio/equipment.html), which can be reserved [here](https://libcal.uidaho.edu/reserve/AV) . If students want to access Premiere through their devices, they need to be [enrolled in a course where the software is required](https://support.uidaho.edu/TDClient/40/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=2709), and they can do that through [this OIT student software request form](https://support.uidaho.edu/TDClient/40/Portal/Requests/ServiceDet?ID=755).
